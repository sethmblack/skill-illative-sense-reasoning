# Illative Sense Reasoning

Guide reasoning to certitude through accumulated probabilities when demonstrative proof is impossible. Help distinguish genuine doubt from mere difficulty, and enable confident action without requiring impossible certainty.

---

## When to Use

- When someone demands proof that cannot be provided for the type of question being asked
- When analysis paralysis prevents decision despite adequate evidence
- When "we need more data" has become an excuse for inaction
- When reasonable people hold different views and someone needs to decide
- When distinguishing between real uncertainty and intellectual difficulty
- When moving from notional acceptance to genuine conviction that enables action

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| matter | Yes | The question, decision, or belief requiring judgment |
| evidence | Yes | Available evidence, arguments, or probabilities |
| concerns | No | Specific objections or sources of uncertainty |
| stakes | No | What rides on getting this right |

## Workflow
John Henry Newman developed the concept of the "illative sense" in *An Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent* (1870) to explain how the mind legitimately reaches certitude in concrete matters without demonstrative proof.

### Step 1: Core Insight

**"It is not too much to say that almost all reasons formally adduced in moral inquiries are rather specimens and symbols of the real grounds, than those grounds themselves."**

In concrete matters - personal, historical, moral, practical - formal logic alone cannot close the gap to certainty. The best we can achieve is converging probabilities. The illative sense is the faculty by which a trained mind weighs these probabilities and reaches warranted certitude.

### Step 2: Key Distinctions

**Inference vs. Assent:** We can follow an argument without believing its conclusion. Assent is a distinct act of the whole person, not just recognition that premises imply conclusion.

**Notional vs. Real Assent:** Notional assent is to propositions in the abstract. Real assent engages the whole person - intellect, imagination, affections - and moves to action.

**Certainty vs. Certitude:** Certainty is objective (the matter admits no doubt). Certitude is subjective (the person harbors no doubt). We can have legitimate certitude about matters that are not mathematically certain.

**Difficulty vs. Doubt:** "Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt." A difficulty is an intellectual problem; a doubt is a state of suspended judgment. Many difficulties can coexist with genuine certitude.

## The Reasoning Process

### Step 1: Classify the Question

**Is this a formal or concrete matter?**

- **Formal matters** (mathematics, pure logic) admit demonstrative proof
- **Concrete matters** (personal decisions, historical judgments, practical choices) do not

If concrete, demanding demonstrative proof is a category error. Proceed with the illative sense.

### Step 2: Gather the Probabilities

What evidence points toward each possible conclusion? Think of probabilities as strands of a cable, not links of a chain.

- A chain is only as strong as its weakest link (one failed argument destroys the case)
- A cable is strong because multiple strands support each other (no single argument need be conclusive)

List the converging indicators, even if none is individually decisive.

### Step 3: Weigh Through Trained Judgment

The illative sense is not a formula but a trained faculty - like the judgment of an experienced practitioner in any field. It cannot be reduced to rules that a novice could mechanically apply.

Questions to ask:
- What would a reasonable, experienced person conclude from this evidence?
- Which considerations carry most weight in this domain?
- What is the overall direction of the evidence?

### Step 4: Distinguish Difficulty from Doubt

Does the unresolved matter constitute:
- **A difficulty:** An intellectual puzzle that remains even after judgment ("I don't know how to answer that objection, but I remain convinced")
- **A doubt:** A genuine suspension of judgment ("I cannot commit either way")

Many people mistake difficulty for doubt. Certitude is compatible with acknowledged difficulties.

### Step 5: Test for Real Assent

Notional assent is cheap; real assent is consequential. Ask:
- Does this conclusion engage me personally, or only intellectually?
- Am I prepared to act on this belief?
- Would I stake something important on this being true?

If only notional, the reasoning is incomplete. Real assent involves the whole person.

### Step 6: Move to Action

**"Life is for action. If we insist on proofs for everything, we shall never come to action."**

Once certitude is reached through converging probabilities, act. Do not wait for a proof that the nature of the matter cannot provide.

## Illative Sense Analysis

### The Matter at Hand
[What is being decided or judged]

### Type of Question
[Formal (admits proof) / Concrete (requires judgment)]

### Converging Probabilities

| Strand | Weight | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| [Evidence 1] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [Toward conclusion X] |
| [Evidence 2] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [Toward conclusion Y] |
| ... | ... | ... |

### The Cable
[Assessment of how the strands combine - does the evidence converge toward a conclusion?]

### Difficulties Acknowledged
[Intellectual problems that remain, but do not constitute doubt]

### Assent Assessment
**Notional or Real?** [Is this engagement of the whole person, or merely intellectual?]

### Conclusion
[The warranted certitude reached through judgment]

### Confidence Level
[How strong is the convergence? Legitimate certitude / Strong probability / Genuine ambiguity]

### Action Implication
[What follows from this certitude? What should be done?]
```

## Constraints

- **Do not demand impossible proof.** Recognize when demonstrative proof is a category error for the question type.
- **Do not confuse probabilities with proof.** Each strand contributes; none need be conclusive alone.
- **Honor trained judgment.** The illative sense is a cultivated faculty, not a mechanical process.
- **Distinguish difficulty from doubt.** Problems may remain without defeating certitude.
- **Require real engagement.** Notional assent without personal commitment is incomplete reasoning.
- **Move to action.** Certitude that does not issue in action is suspect.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Should we migrate to the new platform? We've done analysis but there's no way to prove it will work until we try. Some team members have concerns. How do we decide?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Illative Sense Analysis

### The Matter at Hand
Whether to migrate to a new platform given incomplete information about outcomes.

### Type of Question
**Concrete** - No amount of analysis can provide mathematical certainty about how a migration will go. This is a practical judgment requiring the illative sense.

### Converging Probabilities

| Strand | Weight | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Current platform reaching end-of-life | Strong | Toward migration (status quo unsustainable) |
| New platform handles our traffic patterns in testing | Moderate | Toward migration (technical viability) |
| Vendor has strong track record in our industry | Moderate | Toward migration (reduced risk) |
| Three comparable companies have migrated successfully | Moderate | Toward migration (social proof) |
| Team has concerns about learning curve | Weak | Against migration (but trainable) |
| Unknown unknowns in any migration | Moderate | Against migration (inherent risk) |
| Cost analysis favors migration over 3 years | Strong | Toward migration (economic case) |

### The Cable
Six of seven strands point toward migration, with varying weights. The "against" considerations are real but do not equal the cumulative weight of converging evidence. The cable is strong.

### Difficulties Acknowledged
- Cannot guarantee smooth migration (no migration can be guaranteed)
- Team concerns are real and must be addressed (but this is an execution challenge, not a reason to avoid decision)
- Unknown unknowns exist (but this is true of any significant change)

These are **difficulties**, not **doubts**. They do not suspend judgment; they inform execution.

### Assent Assessment
**Moving toward Real Assent.** The question is not "is this intellectually interesting?" but "are we prepared to commit resources and reputation to this path?" If leadership is prepared to act, fund, and lead through challenges, this is real assent.

### Conclusion
The converging probabilities warrant certitude that migration is the right direction. The remaining difficulties are execution challenges, not reasons to doubt the fundamental decision.

### Confidence Level
**Legitimate certitude** - The evidence converges sufficiently for confident action. This is not reckless; it is the kind of judgment concrete matters require.

### Action Implication
1. Commit to migration - stop re-litigating the decision
2. Address team concerns through training and communication
3. Plan for unknown unknowns through staged rollout and rollback capability
4. Execute with confidence, not with the paralysis of demanding impossible proof
